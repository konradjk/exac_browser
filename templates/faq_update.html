                    We anticipate the publication of a flagship paper describing this data set in late 2015. Until that is published, please cite the <a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/10/30/030338">bioRxiv</a> preprint.

                    Many of the individuals who have contributed data to ExAC were not fully consented for phenotype data sharing, and unfortunately at this time we are typically unable to provide any information about the clinical status of variant carriers. We have made every effort to exclude individuals with severe pediatric diseases from the ExAC data set, and certainly do not expect our data set to be <i>enriched</i> for such individuals, but we typically cannot rule out the possibility that some of our participants do actually suffer from your disease of interest.

                    In the future it may be possible to obtain phenotype data for a subset of ExAC samples. If you are interested in using such data in your studies, please <a href="mailto:exomeconsortium@gmail.com">email us</a>.

You can freely download and search the data, and use it for publications focused on specific sets of variants (for instance, assessing the frequency of a set of candidate causal variants observed in a collection of rare disease patients).

                    <h4 class="media-heading">How was the expected number of variants determined?</h4>
                    We used a depth corrected probability of mutation for each gene to predict the expected variant counts. More details can be found in section 4.1 of the supplement in <a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/10/30/030338">Lek et al</a>.

                    <h4 class="media-heading">Which variants are included in the observed counts?</h4>
                    We included single nucleotide changes that occured in the canonical transcript and had 123 or fewer alternative alleles and a VQSLOD >= -2.632. The counts represent the number of unique variants and not the allele count of said variants.

                    <h4 class="media-heading">Why are there fewer variants in the constraint table than depicted on the gene page?</h4>
                    We only included variants that were found in the canonical transcript of the gene. On the gene page, variants found in all transcripts are depicted.

                    <p>For synonymous and missense, we created a signed Z score for the deviation of observed counts from the expected number. Positive Z scores indicate increased constraint (intolerance to variation) and therefore that the gene had fewer variants than expected. Negative Z scores are given to genes that had a more variants than expected.</p>
                    <p>For LoF, we assume that there are three classes of genes with respect to tolerance to LoF variation: null (where LoF variation is completely tolerated), recessive (where heterozygous LoFs are tolerated), and haploinsufficient (where heterozygous LoFs are not tolerated). We used the observed and expected variants counts to determine the probability that a given gene is extremely intolerant of loss-of-function variation (falls into the third category). The closer pLI is to one, the more LoF intolerant the gene appears to be. We consider pLI >= 0.9 as an extremely LoF intolerant set of genes.</p>

                    <h4 class="media-heading">Why does the browser seem to disagree with the ExAC VCF at this multiallelic site?</h4>
                    Due to the limitations of the VCF format, multi-allelic variants are put together on one VCF line.
                    This inevitably adds complexity to otherwise simple variants,
                    and thus when parsing onto the browser, we apply a <a href="http://www.cureffi.org/2014/04/24/converting-genetic-variants-to-their-minimal-representation/">minimal representation</a> script.
                    For instance, a variant whose REF is GC and ALT alleles are TC,G - the first ALT allele is actually a SNP and will be represented in the browser as G->T.

                    No. We were not given permission from dbGaP to include individuals from several of the cohorts included in the NHLBI's Exome Sequencing Project. As a result, genuine rare variants that are present in the EVS may not be observed in ExAC.
